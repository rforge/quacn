	studies to recognize and characterize effects of xenobiotics on organs

	effects which are detectable in easily accessible biological fluids
	such as blood. A fundamental challenge in such biomarker studies
	is selecting among the plethora of biomolecular changes induced by
	a compound and revealed by molecular profiling, to identify biomarkers
	which are exclusively or predominantly due to specific processes.
	In this work we present a cross-compartment correlation network approach,
	involving no a priori supervision or design, to integrate proteomic,
	metabolomic and transcriptomic data for selecting circulating biomarkers.
	The case study we present is the identification of biomarkers of
	drug-induced hepatic toxicity effects in a rodent model. Biomolecular
	profiling of both blood plasma and liver tissue from Wistar Hannover
	rats administered a toxic compound yielded many hundreds of statistically
	significant molecular changes. We exploited drug-induced correlations
	between blood plasma analytes and liver tissue molecules across study
	animals in order to nominate selected plasma molecules as biomarkers
	of drug-induced hepatic alterations of lipid metabolism and urea
	cycle processes.},

  abstract = {The role of the correlation structure of gene expression data are
	two-fold: It is a source of complications and useful information

	gene expression levels in statistical methodologies for microarray
	data analysis may deteriorate their performance. However, there is
	a host of valuable information in the correlation structure that

	remedy deficiencies of currently practiced methods that are focused
	too heavily on strong effects in terms of differential expression
	of genes. The present paper discusses the utility of correlation
	measures in microarray data analysis and gene regulatory network
	reconstruction, along with various pitfalls in both research areas
	that have been uncovered in methodological studies. These issues
	have broad applicability to all genomic studies examining the biology,

  abstract = {Prostate cancer accounts for about 25\% of all the newly diagnosed
	cancers in American men and was projected to cause >28,000 deaths
	in 2008. Black men are disproportionately affected; their incidence
	rate is about 1.6 times greater than the rate for white men. As the
	population ages, the number of new cases per year is expected to
	increase by >60\% and reach 300,000 by 2015. This high incidence,
	coupled with the protracted onset of the disease, makes PCa a particularly
	appropriate candidate for prevention and early intervention strategies.
	Potential disease precursors, particularly high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
	neoplasia, might help identify men at high risk of developing PCa.
	Dihydrotestosterone, a product converted from testosterone by 5alpha-reductases,
	plays an important role in normal prostate growth and in the development
	of PCa. The 5alpha-reductase levels, particularly type 1, appear
	to increase during the disease course of prostatic intraepithelial
	neoplasia and PCa, with greater expression occurring as the disease
	progresses. Therefore, the inhibition of 5alpha-reductase could potentially
	reduce the risk of PCa development, slow or prevent disease progression,
	and/or treat existing disease. A substantial research effort has
	recently focused on understanding the pathways involved in the disease's
	emergence and progression, particularly the 5alpha-reductase pathway.},

  abstract = {RESULTS: This paper presents the R/Bioconductor package minet (version
	1.1.6) which provides a set of functions to infer mutual information
	networks from a dataset. Once fed with a microarray dataset, the
	package returns a network where nodes denote genes, edges model statistical
	dependencies between genes and the weight of an edge quantifies the
	statistical evidence of a specific (e.g transcriptional) gene-to-gene
	interaction. Four different entropy estimators are made available
	in the package minet (empirical, Miller-Madow, Schurmann-Grassberger
	and shrink) as well as four different inference methods, namely relevance
	networks, ARACNE, CLR and MRNET. Also, the package integrates accuracy
	assessment tools, like F-scores, PR-curves and ROC-curves in order
	to compare the inferred network with a reference one. CONCLUSION:
	The package minet provides a series of tools for inferring transcriptional
	networks from microarray data. It is freely available from the Comprehensive
	R Archive Network (CRAN) as well as from the Bioconductor website.},

  abstract = {A vital quest in biology is comprehensible visualization and interpretation
	of correlation relationships on a genome scale. Such relationships
	may be represented in the form of networks, which usually require
	disassembly into smaller manageable units, or clusters, to facilitate
	interpretation. Several graph-clustering algorithms that may be used
	to visualize biological networks are available. However, only some
	of these support weighted edges, and none provides good control of
	cluster sizes, which is crucial for comprehensible visualization
	of large networks. We constructed an interactive coexpression network
	for the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome using a novel Heuristic
	Cluster Chiseling Algorithm (HCCA) that supports weighted edges and
	that may control average cluster sizes. Comparative clustering analyses
	demonstrated that the HCCA performed as well as, or better than,
	the commonly used Markov, MCODE, and k-means clustering algorithms.
	We mapped MapMan ontology terms onto coexpressed node vicinities
	of the network, which revealed transcriptional organization of previously
	unrelated cellular processes. We further explored the predictive
	power of this network through mutant analyses and identified six
	new genes that are essential to plant growth. We show that the HCCA-partitioned
	network constitutes an ideal "cartographic" platform for visualization
	of correlation networks. This approach rapidly provides network partitions
	with relative uniform cluster sizes on a genome-scale level and may
	thus be used for correlation network layouts also for other species.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma is a highly malignant soft tissue sarcoma
	in childhood and arises as a consequence of regulatory disruption
	of the growth and differentiation pathways of myogenic precursor
	cells. The pathogenic pathways involved in this tumor are mostly
	unknown and therefore a better characterization of RMS gene expression
	profile would represent a considerable advance. The availability
	of publicly available gene expression datasets have opened up new
	challenges especially for the integration of data generated by different
	research groups and different array platforms with the purpose of
	obtaining new insights on the biological process investigated. RESULTS:
	In this work we performed a meta-analysis on four microarray and
	two SAGE datasets of gene expression data on RMS in order to evaluate
	the degree of agreement of the biological results obtained by these
	different studies and to identify common regulatory pathways that
	could be responsible of tumor growth. Regulatory pathways and biological
	processes significantly enriched has been investigated and a list
	of differentially meta-profiles have been identified as possible
	candidate of aggressiveness of RMS. CONCLUSION: Our results point
	to a general down regulation of the energy production pathways, suggesting
	a hypoxic physiology for RMS cells. This result agrees with the high
	malignancy of RMS and with its resistance to most of the therapeutic
	treatments. In this context, different isoforms of the ANT gene have
	been consistently identified for the first time as differentially
	expressed in RMS. This gene is involved in anti-apoptotic processes
	when cells grow in low oxygen conditions. These new insights in the
	biological processes responsible of RMS growth and development demonstrate
	the effective advantage of the use of integrated analysis of gene
	expression studies.},

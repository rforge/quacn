\title{Two-edges-deleted subgraph complexity
}
\description{This method calculates the two-edges-deleted subgraph
  complexity based on Laplacian matrices.
}
\usage{
twoEdgesDeletedSubgraphComplexity(g, subgraphs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{g}{
a graph as a graphNEL object.
}
  \item{subgraphs}{
the two-edges-deleted subgraphs of g as a list of adjacency matrices, as
returned by edgeDeletedSubgraphs(edgeDeletedSubgraphs(g)).  If this
parameter is omitted, the subgraphs will be calculated automatically.
}
}
\details{
  This method calculates the two-edges-deleted subgraph complexity with
  respect to different spectra of the Laplacian and signless Laplacian
  matrix.
}
\value{
  The return value is the described two-edges-deleted subgraph
  complexity measure as a double-precision floating point number.

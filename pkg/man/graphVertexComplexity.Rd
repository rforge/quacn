\description{This method calculates the Graph Vertex Complexity.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
graphVertexComplexity(g, dist = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{g}{a graph as a graphNEL object.
%%     ~~Describe \code{g} here~~
}
  \item{dist}{the distance matrix of the graph. If the parameter is empty the distance matrix will be calculated within the function.
%%     ~~Describe \code{dist} here~~
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{This method returns the Graph Vertex Complexity.
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}

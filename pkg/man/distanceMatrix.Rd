\title{Distance Matrix
}
\description{This method calculates the distance Matrix of a given graph.
}
\usage{
distanceMatrix(g, keep.weights=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{g}{ The graphNEL object for which the distance matrix will be calculated.}
  \item{keep.weights}{A flag indicating whether weights should be
    considered when performing the conversion (DEFAULT= FALSE). \emph{currently ignored, added for later development}}
}

\details{This method returns the distance Matrix of a given graph. If the
  graph is weighted it will be treated as if it was an unweighted
  graph.
}
\value{A distance matrix with dimensions V(g) x V(g).
}
\note{
  Currently we ignore the edge weight information when calculating the
  distance matrix. This will most likely change in future versions.

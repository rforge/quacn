\description{
This method calculates the efficiency complexity measure.
}
\usage{
efficiency(g, dist=NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{g}{
a graph as a graphNEL object.
}
  \item{dist}{
the distance matrix of the graph.  Will be calculated automatically if
left empty.
}
}
\details{
  This method calculates the efficiency complexity measure.
}
\value{
  It returns the efficiency complexity measure as a double-precision
  floating point value.

\title{One-edge-deleted subgraph complexity measures
}
\description{This method calculates two indices based on
  one-edge-deleted subgraphs.
}
\usage{
oneEdgeDeletedSubgraphComplexity(g, subgraphs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{g}{
a graph as a graphNEL object.
}
  \item{subgraphs}{
the one-edge-deleted subgraphs of g as a list of adjacency matrices, as
returned by edgeDeletedSubgraphs(g).  If this parameter is omitted, the
subgraphs will be calculated automatically.
}
}
\details{
  This method calculates the one-edge-deleted subgraph complexity with
  respect to the different number of spanning trees (C_1eST) and spectra
  of the Laplacian and signless Laplacian matrix (C_1eSpec).
}
\value{
  The results are returned in a list with two entries named C_1eST and
  C_1eSpec.
